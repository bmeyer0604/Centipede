Centipede is a retro arcade game in which a player-controlled spaceship must defeat a monster centipede (and various other bugs). The player controls the spaceship in order to destroy the bugs. This version is made 100% through JavaScript and can be run through "npm run start."

The player can:

-control the ship on a 2D plane with the arrow keys

-shoot lasers in order to destroy either bugs or mushrooms blocking the way (with the spacebar)

-die if they come in contact with any enemies

-restart the game in order to try again

The centipede moves in a preset pattern from the top of the screen to the bottom, changing direction whenever it comes in contact with a wall or a mushroom.

Other bugs include:

-fleas, which plant new mushrooms

-scorpions, which poison mushrooms (centipedes will come directly down if they come in contact with a poisoned mushroom)

-spiders, which jump across the screen
